# OWNER DECISIONS PENDING

Genuinely owner-level decisions only: company purpose, constitutional authority
semantics, irreversible external consequence, real money, legal or compliance
commitment, communication to real users, pilot activation, production
credentials, destructive production-data mutation, or product policy with
several materially different legitimate readings.

Ordinary technical decisions are not queued here — they are made and recorded in
git history. Nothing below blocks all high-value work; the campaign continues
around each item.

# EIGHT ANSWERED, TWO PENDING

The owner answered the first eight queued decisions; those are recorded below as
settled, with the record of what was asked and why in git history. Two items are
pending at the end of this file. Neither blocks the campaign: §9 needs counsel
rather than the owner alone, and §10 has a recommended answer and a stated live
gap while it waits.

---

## RESOLVED 1 — Real bounded support pilot: **HOLD for adapter breadth**

`support-pilot-readiness-v1` stays green and keeps meaning only *READY TO
ATTEMPT*. E4 remains unclaimed and external. Revisit when integration breadth
catches up with the architecture — the remaining gap is adapters, not kernel.

## RESOLVED 2 — Recursive Foundry: **REPORT ONLY, NOT THE GRANT**

The owner will report the schema-snapshot obligation in the deployed
environment. The bounded regeneration grant is deliberately NOT performed yet,
so Foundry may not mutate its own repository outside a test.

**What this means for the campaign:** the recursive vertical stays proven
locally. Do not simulate the report, and do not treat a local run as the
deployed one. `recursive-institution-v1` continues to report ordinary on the
dimensions it exercises, and production recursion remains external proof debt
until the owner's action lands.

## RESOLVED 3 — `challenger` and `synthesizer`: **THEY SHOULD BE LIVE**

The owner was right, and my classification was wrong. Both are already
production-reachable and always were:

- Neither is an agent. Both say so in their own first lines — *"NOT a BaseAgent
  subclass — runs on demand during debate orchestration"* — and both export
  standalone functions with no `run(productId)`, so no loader could instantiate
  them even if the vocabulary named them.
- `debate/orchestrator.ts` statically imports both, and the orchestrator is
  called from the scheduler and from a dashboard route.

I had classified them `evidence-insufficient` on the reasoning "outside
ALL_AGENTS, so no loader can select it". True, and irrelevant: it inferred
deadness from the DIRECTORY rather than from reachability — the same category
error that once made the orphan report name ~160KB of live dynamically-loaded
code as dead. **Being in `agents/` is not what makes something an agent.**

Reclassified as production-reachable, and the gate now checks the distinction
directly: a module in that directory is an agent only if the vocabulary names
it, and anything else there must have a real importer or it really is dead.
Mutation-tested with a stray module claiming reachability it did not have.

## RESOLVED 4 — Effect kinds stay **CONSTITUTIONAL**

A company may declare what it counts, because reading a number is harmless. It
may never declare a new irreversible way to reach the outside world. Every new
effect kind is a migration and a review — that cost is small and visible, and
the cost of the alternative is a company inventing an irreversible action for
itself.

**Standing rule for future work:** do not add a mechanism that lets effect
kinds be created at runtime, by a company, an integration, or a model.

---

## RESOLVED 5 — The public API: **MAKE IT LIVE**

`/api/v1` and the Fathom/Fireflies transcript webhooks were mounted,
authenticated, and unreachable by anyone — nothing could issue a key, and the
endpoint the dashboard advertised did not exist and could not have.

The owner chose to make it live rather than leave it dormant or delete it.

**What this meant in practice.** Turning it on required first fixing what would
otherwise have shipped with it: three write routes gated by `agents:read`, and
an MCP transport with no scope check at all. Issuance is built like the scoped
ingest credentials — explicit scopes from a closed set, mandatory expiry,
revocable, evidence-recorded, hash-only storage.

**Standing consequence:** the API is now a real external surface. Every new v1
route needs a scope that a founder can actually grant, and the bidirectional
gate enforces that in both directions. Transcript ingestion is reachable, which
means real customer call content can now arrive and be analysed — that path is
customer data and untrusted external content, and must be treated as both.

---

## RESOLVED 6 — An unpaid account is **READ-ONLY**

A founder who never subscribed, or whose trial expired without converting, was
indistinguishable from a paying customer to every capability gate: `scp_status`
stayed 'active' from onboarding, `tier` stayed NULL, and nothing read trial
expiry. Agents kept running, governed effects kept sending, AI spend kept
accruing — indefinitely, for an account that would never pay.

The owner chose: **data and history stay readable; Foundry stops spending money
and stops reaching outward.**

**How it is enforced, and why that way.** The hourly `entitlement_sweep` writes
the same `products.scp_status = 'paused'` that `customer.subscription.deleted`
already writes, so every check that honours a cancellation honours a lapsed
trial too. No second mechanism to keep in agreement.

**Standing consequences:**

- Entitlement to act = a paid tier OR a live trial **OR a period already paid
  for** (amended by decision 7). Nothing else.
- The sweep resumes as well as pauses. Do not make it one-way.
- It is **not a revocation**: consents are untouched and nothing is demoted, so
  subscribing restores the permission the founder already gave.
- Any NEW capability that spends money or reaches outward must be reachable only
  through a path that already honours `scp_status`, or it will silently be free.

**Correction, one batch later.** The sentence above about "every check that
honours a cancellation" was an assumption about the rest of the codebase, and it
was false in three places: the outbound gateway's kill-switch read
`products.status` (the archive axis) and never `scp_status`; thirty-four
background jobs chose their work through a helper that did the same; and the
data-deletion path wrote `status='archived'` without touching the acting axis,
so a company whose founder had withdrawn consent stayed on every agent's work
list. Both axes are now read through one exported predicate,
`operatingProduct()`. **Reusing an existing mechanism does not mean the
mechanism was already total.**

## RESOLVED 7 — Follow **ordinary SaaS convention** for access and communication

Asked whether a paused account should be reachable at all, the owner answered a
larger question: *"People should be able to use their accounts until their
subscription period is ended even if they cancel like most apps do.
Communication between foundry and customers should be typical and consistent
with SaaS convention."*

**Standing consequences:**

- **Cancelling ends the plan, not the period.** `cancelSubscription` sets
  `cancel_at_period_end`; it must never call `subscriptions.cancel()`, which
  forfeits time already paid for. `founders.paid_through` records the period
  Stripe reports, and it survives cancellation on purpose.
- **The billing webhook records facts and asks the rule.** It must not decide a
  pause itself — that was how service came to end mid-period. One rule,
  `entitledToAct`, used by both the webhook and the hourly sweep.
- **Dunning is a grace period, not a cut-off.** A past-due account keeps working
  through Stripe's retries, which falls out of `paid_through` rather than being
  a second mechanism.
- **Account mail always reaches the customer; operational mail does not.**
  `send_account_notice` is the ONLY capability exempt from the pause, its body
  is rendered server-side from five fixed kinds, and it covers `paused` but not
  `archived`. A second exempt capability is a decision, not a copy-paste — a
  test asserts exactly one exists.
- Lifecycle mail that must exist: trial ending (3 days out), trial ended /
  read-only started, cancellation confirmed with the date access stops, payment
  failed.

## RESOLVED 8 — Push notifications: **WIRE THEM THROUGH THE GATEWAY**

`POST /api/push/register` and `/api/push/preferences` had been live since the
mobile API shipped, and nothing had ever sent a push. The owner chose to build
the channel rather than remove the surface.

**Standing consequences:**

- Push is the `send_push` gateway capability. It inherits the kill-switch, the
  entitlement pause, dedup and audit; it must never reach the network directly.
- A push with no `productId` has no authority context and fails closed.
- The notification type names a database COLUMN. It is resolved through a frozen
  map, never interpolated from an argument.

# NEWLY PENDING

## PENDING 9 — Retention periods for what survives an erasure: **COUNSEL**

Foundry now states, for every table that survives a company's erasure, what is
kept, on what basis, what may be done with it while it is kept, and when the
decision should be looked at again. Those `reviewAfterDays` values are
ENGINEERING ESTIMATES. They are not legal conclusions and this campaign will
not turn them into any:

| what survives | basis recorded | review after |
|---|---|---|
| `ai_spend_reservations` | cost accounting; live ceilings | 365 days |
| `idempotency_keys` | at-most-once records for effects already sent | 30 days |
| `products` (redacted shell) | referential integrity; the id must not be reissued | never |
| `founders` (redacted shell) | same, plus retained financial records reference it | never |
| `agent_audit_log` (two event types) | the record that the erasure happened | never |

**What is actually being asked.** Three things, and only counsel can answer
them:

1. **Are the periods right for the jurisdictions Foundry operates in?** A
   financial record retained 365 days is a guess at the shortest defensible
   period. Several regimes require longer for accounting records and shorter
   for anything identifying a person, and those two pull in opposite directions
   on the same row.
2. **Is a redacted shell erasure?** `products` and `founders` survive with the
   id and nothing else — every describing column cleared, the email replaced
   with `erased+<id>@invalid`, the identity-provider handle severed. The
   engineering claim is that what remains identifies nobody. Whether that
   satisfies a deletion request is a legal question about the row, not an
   engineering one about the columns.
3. **Does keeping the erasure trail itself need its own basis?** Two
   `agent_audit_log` event types are kept forever as evidence the erasure
   happened. That is self-evidently useful and not self-evidently lawful.

**Until it is answered.** The dispositions stand as written and the erasure
runs on them — this is proof debt, not a blocker. Nothing in the code claims
these periods are legally required; each says only what purpose it serves. If
counsel changes a period, the change is one number in `RETAINED_ON_ERASURE`
and the tests that pin the basis strings will catch anything that drifts from
what was decided.

**Not asked here:** whether to retain more. The campaign's answer to every
"could we keep this" has been no unless a stated purpose needs it, and that is
an engineering decision already made.

## PENDING 10 — When a member erases their account, what happens to the company assets they configured?

**The situation.** A person can be a member of a company they do not own.
Erasing their account now reaches those companies: their conversations,
journal, notifications, consents and membership are deleted, and the company's
own records — its audit trail, its decisions, its integration history — are
severed so they stay and stop naming the person.

Five tables cannot be settled that way, because the row is a **company asset
the company is still running on**, on a NOT NULL column:

| Table | What it is |
|---|---|
| `api_keys` | a credential the company may currently be authenticating with |
| `mcp_grants` | an authority grant the company may depend on |
| `webhooks` | an integration that may be delivering right now |
| `deal_rooms` | a shared artefact other people are using |
| `decision_votes` | part of the company's decision record — and the person's own written rationale is inside it |

**The tension, plainly.** Deleting these takes a working capability away from a
company that did nothing wrong — a webhook stops delivering, an API key stops
authenticating, a decision loses a vote that was genuinely cast. Keeping them
keeps the erased person's identity in a live company, which is the thing an
erasure exists to remove. The columns are NOT NULL, so severing to nothing is
not available without a schema change and a marker value.

**Three legitimate readings, all defensible:**

1. **The person wins.** Delete. An erasure means erasure; a company that relied
   on a departing member's credential should re-establish it. Cost: silent
   breakage in a company with no warning.
2. **The company wins.** Keep the row, transfer ownership to the company owner,
   and record the transfer. Cost: the erased person's id survives until the
   transfer runs, and somebody must decide who inherits.
3. **Split by kind.** Revoke the credentials (`api_keys`, `mcp_grants`) because
   an authority held by a person who no longer exists should not act, and
   transfer or anonymise the artefacts (`webhooks`, `deal_rooms`,
   `decision_votes`) because they are the company's work.

**Recommendation: 3.** It is the only one that distinguishes *authority* from
*artefact*, which is a distinction the constitution already makes everywhere
else — authority held by a principal that no longer exists should not survive
the principal, while a record the company authored should. It needs a schema
change to make the artefact columns nullable, or a company-owned marker
principal, which is why it is not simply done.

**Until it is answered.** These five tables are marked `owner_decision` in
`PERSON_ACROSS_COMPANIES` and are deliberately NOT touched by the erasure. A
test asserts every table in that surface carries a disposition, so the deferral
is visible rather than an omission — but it IS a live gap: an erased person's
id remains in those five tables in companies they did not own.
